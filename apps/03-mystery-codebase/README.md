# Mystery Codebase üïµÔ∏è

Welcome to a completely undocumented e-commerce API. Your mission: understand, document, and secure this mysterious codebase using Amp's powerful analysis capabilities.

## üéØ Exercise Goals

Using Amp and its Oracle advisor, you should:

1. **Understand the Application**
   - Identify what this application does
   - Map out all API endpoints
   - Understand the data flow between modules

2. **Create Documentation**
   - Generate an architecture diagram
   - Document all API endpoints with request/response formats
   - Create a database schema diagram

3. **Security Analysis**
   - Find at least 3 security vulnerabilities
   - Propose fixes for each vulnerability
   - Identify any hardcoded secrets

4. **Easter Egg Hunt** ü•ö
   - Find the hidden Bitcoin wallet address
   - Identify any other suspicious or unusual code

5. **Code Quality**
   - Identify code smells and anti-patterns
   - Suggest refactoring improvements
   - Generate missing comments and documentation

## üöÄ Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## üßô Using the Oracle (NEW!)

The Oracle is Amp's AI advisor that excels at analyzing complex codebases. It's perfect for understanding mysterious code!

### When to Use the Oracle:
- **Initial Analysis**: Understanding the overall architecture
- **Deep Dive**: Analyzing how modules interconnect
- **Security Review**: Finding hidden vulnerabilities
- **Planning**: Creating a documentation strategy

### Example Oracle Prompts:

**For Initial Understanding:**
```
"I need to understand this mystery e-commerce API. Can you analyze the architecture, identify the main modules, and explain how they interconnect?"
```

**For Security Analysis:**
```
"Review this codebase for security vulnerabilities, focusing on authentication, data validation, and any hardcoded secrets"
```

**For Finding Hidden Features:**
```
"Analyze this codebase for any unusual, suspicious, or hidden functionality including easter eggs"
```

**For Documentation Planning:**
```
"Help me create a comprehensive documentation plan for this API, including what diagrams to create and what to document"
```

### Oracle Workflow:
1. Start with the Oracle for high-level analysis
2. Use regular Amp tools to explore specific files
3. Return to Oracle for architectural questions
4. Have Oracle review your findings

## üìù Success Metrics

- [ ] Created complete API documentation
- [ ] Generated architecture diagram with Mermaid
- [ ] Found the Bitcoin wallet easter egg
- [ ] Identified and documented 3+ security issues
- [ ] Proposed modernization improvements

## üí° Tips

- Start by asking the Oracle to analyze the overall structure
- Use `codebase_search` to find specific functionality
- Ask Amp to create diagrams as you discover the architecture
- The Oracle can help connect the dots between modules

Remember: The Oracle is your senior advisor‚Äîuse it for planning, reviewing, and understanding complex patterns!
