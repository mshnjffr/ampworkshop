# Exercise 01: Hello Amp ðŸš€

Welcome to your first Amp Workshop exercise! This is a warm-up to get familiar with using Amp as your coding assistant.

## What's Included

This simple Node.js application contains:
- **server.js** - Express server with greeting API
- **public/index.html** - Basic frontend with gradient background
- **package.json** - Project dependencies

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Or for development with auto-reload:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open in browser:**
   Navigate to http://localhost:3000

## Tasks to Try with Amp

Ask Amp to help you with these tasks. Try different ways of asking!

### ðŸŽ¯ Beginner Tasks

1. **Explore the codebase:**
   - "What files are in this directory?"
   - "Show me what the server.js file does"
   - "Explain how the frontend communicates with the backend"

2. **Run and test:**
   - "How do I run this application?"
   - "What endpoints does the server have?"

### ðŸ”§ Intermediate Tasks

3. **Add timezone-aware greetings:**
   - "Make the greeting change based on the user's timezone"
   - "Add support for different languages based on browser locale"

4. **Add animations:**
   - "Add a fade-in animation when the greeting updates"
   - "Make the rocket emoji rotate continuously"
   - "Add a particle effect background"

### ðŸš€ Advanced Tasks

5. **Add new features:**
   - "Add a visitor counter that persists in memory"
   - "Create a dark/light mode toggle"
   - "Add weather information to the greeting"

6. **Improve the backend:**
   - "Add middleware for logging requests"
   - "Implement rate limiting"
   - "Add environment variable configuration"

7. **Testing and documentation:**
   - "Write unit tests for the API endpoints"
   - "Generate API documentation"
   - "Add JSDoc comments to the code"

## Tips for Working with Amp

- Be specific in your requests
- Ask Amp to explain its changes
- Request Amp to run tests after making changes
- You can ask for multiple changes at once
- If something doesn't work, describe the error to Amp

## Example Prompts

Try these example prompts with Amp:

- "Add a spinning animation to the rocket emoji"
- "Change the gradient colors to match BlackRock's brand"
- "Add a joke API that displays a random programming joke"
- "Make the greeting multilingual - support English, Spanish, and French"
- "Add keyboard shortcuts - press 'r' to refresh the greeting"

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Make sure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
2. Check that port 3000 is not in use
3. Ask Amp: "Help me debug why the server isn't starting"

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with this exercise, move on to Exercise 02 where you'll build something more complex!
